-write a brief introduction describing what the current project is and what skills you will have 
demonstrated once you have completed it. (You can also do this as a 
self-reflection at the end of the project, which is a good way to review what you have learned.)-

Before reflection.
I have learned about Git, Github, and html so far. I believe this project will let me show that I have 
a basic understanding of html boilerplates, basic set ups, paragraphs and ordered and unordered lists. 

But we will see... 

After reflection.
